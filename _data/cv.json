        I am a Senior Software Developer currently working in the role of a Automation / DevOps engineer with more than 6 years of experience in the industry.
		<br>
		I love creating stuff - and working on software development allows me to engage in something that I so much care about. 
		<br>
		I beleive in life long learning and and I find it immensely satisfying when I am able to apply my skills towards solving a problem.
		<br>
		During my professional journey so far I have had the oppurtunity to work in various technologies and assumed diverse roles and responsibilities.
		<br>
		I started my career in 2011 after completing my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and started worked as Software Developer on IBM i platform working on a Canadian mutual fund/insurance product primarily involved in developing and delivering software solutions. 
		Later while working as a Senior Software Developer, I was involved in technical solution designing and consulted on a critical functional module of the product, while engaged in other tasks like code deployment, testing support and production troubleshooting.
		<br>
		Next, I worked as a Senior Consultant for a healthcare client based in North Carolina supporting and maintaining production critical applications.  
		<br>
		Currently, I am working in an automation/DevOps role that involves creating automated solutions for IBM i admin operations activities as well as setting up IBM i devices for monitoring and support that leverages my skills on scripting and DevOps knowledge as well as my strong background on IBM i platform.

			"highlights": ["Designed and implemented an automation that enhanced the automatic resolution percentage from 60 to 90 % for one of our clients. It takes into account the various complex client rules and parses acts on them accordingly. The abstraction of configuration data from application allowed to accommodate any client rule changes with ease without having to modify the automaton.","Implemented a set of best practises and rules for automation creation for better maintainability and reuse. Also applied naming conventions for automations that facilitates easier search and provides a brief idea about the automation scope and purpose.","Setup CI/CD pipelines for development project using AWS CodeCommit ,  CodeBuild , CodePipeline , CodeDeploy enabling effient build and release cycles.","Used containerization technologies (Docker / Docker Swarm) for scaling up of monitoring units and to provide high availability.","Created a reporting framework that allowed the generation of report in a consistent format and allowing easy conversion between various file formats.","Designed an automaton component for capturing information from email requests and deciding actions based on the contents - this came in good use for cases where batch requests were required to be processed.","Created a catalog of IBM i system reports that allows the client to review the changes to system over a given time period , identify potential troublemakers and provide data points for decision making and fine tuining the system","Took over as the sole offshore developer for a client and contributed in existing development work with minimal guidance and self effort." ]
