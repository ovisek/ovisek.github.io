        I am a Senior Software Developer currently working in the role of a Automation / DevOps engineer with more than 6 years of experience in the industry.
		<br>
		I love creating stuff - and working on software development allows me to engage in something that I so much care about. 
		<br>
		I beleive in life long learning and and I find it immensely satisfying when I am able to apply my skills towards solving a problem.
		<br>
		During my professional journey so far I have had the oppurtunity to work in various technologies and assumed diverse roles and responsibilities.
		<br>
		I started my career in 2011 after completing my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and started worked as Software Developer on IBM i platform working on a Canadian mutual fund/insurance product primarily involved in developing and delivering software solutions. 
		Later while working as a Senior Software Developer, I was involved in technical solution designing and consulted on a critical functional module of the product, while engaged in other tasks like code deployment, testing support and production troubleshooting.
		<br>
		Next, I worked as a Senior Consultant for a healthcare client based in North Carolina supporting and maintaining production critical applications.  
		<br>
		Currently, I am working in an automation/DevOps role that involves creating automated solutions for IBM i admin operations activities as well as setting up IBM i devices for monitoring and support that leverages my skills on scripting and DevOps knowledge as well as my strong background on IBM i platform.
