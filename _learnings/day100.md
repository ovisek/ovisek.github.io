**Today's Progress**:

 - Created user with API access . Configured aws-cli with the given API access key id / API secret key before making API requests.
 - Used boto3 to connect to ec2 client and S3 resource.
 - Brief introduction to S3
 - Static website hosting on github - changing the github username had broken the menu links - fixed that.
 
**Thoughts**:

- Need to read the docs on aws-cli and using AWS API
- The jekyll personal blog project is long pending. Still some things are there that I need to get fixed.
